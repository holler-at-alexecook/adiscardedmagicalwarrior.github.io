<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>You are... old news. No longer needed, wanted, or able; just left by the wayside, discarded.</p>
<p>Once you were great, a shining light eclipsing all others. You were capable of so much, wielding more power at your finger tips than few others in existence.  Yiu fought at the front lines, the chosen champion, meant to bring about the end of the war. To bring about some resolution to the long standing strife.</p>
<p>And you did! You accomplished all that and more, in your own way. But then...</p>
<p>You were told many things, given many promises but it amounted to one thing - you were not needed any longer. The gifts they&#39;d granted, gone. The trinkets, resources, instruments of war and even the friends you had made - all gone. The task, once something you&#39;d call your destiny, complete.</p>
<p>&quot;Now what?&quot; You wonder, contemplating your next step...</p>
<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>&#39;A Discarded Magical Warrior&#39; is about what happens AFTER the war is won. Your character, at one time, wielded immense power. Now, these days, they wield a mop. Your character fought dozens, maybe hundreds, of others without breaking a sweat; now they can&#39;t punch without hurting their fist.</p>
<p>What happens when the magical becomes the mundane again?</p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>This is a story seed, a brief with setting notes and character ideas for you to use to start your own tale. Take all of these ideas or only some and use the questions posed to create your character and begin your adventure!</p>
<p>Designed to be used with the Mythic Game Master Emulator 2e, this story seed will help you begin a new solo roleplaying campaign.</p>
<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<p>The inspiration for this came from the Henshin Hero trope which includes things like He-Man &amp; She-Ra, Adventure Time, Steven Universe, Gundam, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Robotech, King Arthur, Guy Gardner, Jem and the Holograms, Madoka Magica, Ben 10, Captain Marvel/Shazam, Freakzoid, Trollhunters, Fire Emblem, Kingdom Hearts, Mario and his various costumes</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use">How To Use</h2>
<p>A story seed seeks to describe a setting or a character archtype, and pose a range of questions to help guide you while creating an original take on the concept. With those asnwers you&#39;ll have a whole new setting to explore and learn more about as you play.</p>
<p>This story seed is broken up into three sections. </p>
<p>The first, Character Creation, asks a range of questions to help you create who you character was and who they are now, as well as other important details like who (or what) gave you these abilities, and what was the reason you were picked in the first place.</p>
<p>The next, Story Creation, poses questions about the Conflict itself and your role in it. How did it start, escalate, and ultimately end? This will help you flesh out your characters backstory and explain why they are in the place they are when the adventure begins.</p>
<p>Finally, its time to play! Using the answers to the questions provided in this story seed, you can add Characters and Threads to your lists and start constructing your first scene.</p>

</ol>
<h1 id="story-creation">Story Creation</h1>
<h2 id="what-was-the-conflict-about">What Was The Conflict About</h2>
<p>Given the specific nature of this section, it would be a perfect candidiate to use with the Backstory Generator found in Mythic Magazine ##.</p>
<p>Questions to think about:</p>
<ol>
<li>How did the conflict begin?</li>
<li>Who were the major players in the conflict?</li>
<li>Did it involve nations or was it more personal, two waring families or companies?</li>

<li>How did the conflict come to an end?</li>
<li>Which side was your character on?</li>
<li>What role did your character play?</li>
<li>Which side won?</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="play-">Play!</h1>
<p>With most of the leg work out of the way, it&#39;s almost time to play! You have a new character and fleshed out setting to explore, but to help create the best experience there are a few steps left to complete.</p>
<h2 id="create-character-stats">Create Character Stats</h2>
<p>Now that you have a clear picture in your head of what your character was, and is now, along with whatever they did in those intervening years, it&#39;s time to roll up some stats. Using your RPG of choie, use these answers as the framework to create your character with. It is up to you if you want to create two sets of stats - one for your unpowered character and one for their alter ego. In most cases an idea of what your characters alter ego was capable of is enough to start your story. If in the course of the tale you need some stats, it&#39;s easy enough to come up with them on the fly. Improvistation is a key to solo roleplaying, and should be embraced within this story seed.</p>
<h2 id="characters-list">Characters List</h2>
<p>With such a detailed back story, there should be plenty of characters you could add to the Characters List. Your characters Patron, any of the people they fought alongside during the conflict, the enemies on the other side of the battle lines - these are all prime examples of Characters you can cross paths with again.</p>
<h2 id="threads-list">Threads List</h2>
<p>Similarly, the setting created by the answers you came up with should spawn more than a few threads you can add to the Threads List. What happened to the losers? Is your character trying to reconnect with your former glory, or is your character running away from it? Pulling a few threads from your backstory will help create a cohesive campaign going forward.</p>
