<h1>Example 2 - The Pizza Wars</h1>
<p>For this example the Player went in with an idea already formed - what would a war between pizzeria&#39;s be like? Based on real world events (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion%27s_Piazza">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion%27s_Piazza</a>) with a henshin bend, the Player starts to create their character.</p>
<h2 id="stats">Stats</h2>
<p>Name: Tyler (he/him)<br/>
Age: 15<br/>
Where: Dayton, OH.<br/>
When: 1980s</p>
<h2 id="who-was-your-character">Who Was Your Character</h2>
<p>Tyler is a young teen boy who grew up in a small town with his single mother. Despite the financial struggles they faced, Tyler&#39;s mother instilled in him a strong work ethic and taught him the value of responsibility. To help with expenses, Tyler began working as a pizza delivery boy at the local pizzeria after school.</p>
<p>Long-term goal: To save up enough money to buy his own car and eventually go to college. Short-term goal: To save enough money to buy a new bike to replace his old one.</p>
<p>Tyler is a responsible and hardworking individual who values family, honesty and dependability.</p>
<p>Unique voice and mannerisms: Tyler has a bit of a shy personality, he is a bit reserved and doesn&#39;t talk much, but when he does he has a soft-spoken voice. He tends to be more comfortable around people he knows well.</p>
<p>One innate strength: Tyler is a punctual person, he is always on time for his shifts and for his deliveries. One area of expertise: Tyler is well-acquainted with the streets of his hometown, making him an efficient delivery boy.</p>
<p>Two character flaws, one they are working on and one they refuse to acknowledge: Tyler is working on being more assertive and standing up for himself, but he refuses to acknowledge that he struggles with anxiety.</p>
<p>The characters reaction to crisis: Tyler&#39;s reaction to a crisis would be to freeze, he tends to freeze up and not know what to do in high-stress situations.</p>
<p>Two core relationships that are crucial to the character&#39;s sense of identity: Tyler&#39;s relationship with his mother and his relationship with his boss at the pizzeria.</p>
<h2 id="alter-ego">Alter Ego</h2>
<p>Given the light nature of the story the Player is going for, Tyler&#39;s alter ego is envisoned as a larger than life character, an opposite to what he is &#39;IRL&#39; as he would say.</p>
<p>The Player decides to start with Tyler&#39;s abilities. Using the Meaning Tables: Descriptions in MGME 2e, the Player rolls twice and got Ceaselessly and Enormous. With a giggle the Player pictures a young Tyler growing in size, like a pizza pie, going from small to medium and eventually to extra extra large!</p>
<p>With another roll the Player gets Fast and Common when picturing what the enormous Tyler would look like. Given the Context, Tyler&#39;s Player decides the alter ego wore a leotard with a pattern of colors that matched the Pizzaria he worked for and called homebase, as well as chrome coated gauntlets, boots and helmet.</p>
<p>The Player decides that, when transforming, Tyler would shout what size of pizza he wanted to be, allowing him to shrink to small size or grow to extra extra large - &quot;I&#39;ll have the extra large pie today Saul!&quot;</p>
<h2 id="patron">Patron</h2>
<p>The Player takes into account what answers they&#39;ve already come up with and picture an elderly Asian man (origin unknown) that uses a secret method of dough making to transform the choisen champion into the warrior of their dreams.</p>
<p>Given the Context and theme the Player is trying to incorporate, they feel they can fill out this area without many rolls on the Meaning Tables or Fate Questions.</p>
<p>Saul has owned the Pizzaria for decades and is one of the last independant pie makers in Dayton, OH., due to the others being slowly bought up by shell corporations that ultimately belong to one man, &quot;The Pizza Baron&quot;.</p>
<p>Saul promised Tyler all the pizza he could eat for life, and Tyler signed on the dotted line.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-your-character-now">Who Is Your Character Now</h2>
<p>The Player is on a roll and continues to lean into the Context and previous answers, forming a picture of who Tyler is after what the Player is now calling &quot;The Pizza Wars&quot;.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been five years since the &quot;Pizza Wars&quot; ended. Tyler has aged, and not well. Consuming pizza, magical or not, still has carbs and fat. Which is what Tyler now is, fat. Overweight and underage, Tyler is jobless as well.</p>
<p>Tyler has been cut off from the magical slices he used to consume. Without that dough, that magical dough Tyler craves still, Tyler is nothing more than a junior college going 20 something with little to no prospects in the farmbelt of the US. Now driving for some app he doesn&#39;t really know how to pronounce the name of (vowels are neccesary people!), Tyler is directionless and frozen, unsure of what to do next.</p>
<h2 id="the-conflict">The Conflict</h2>
<p>&quot;The Pizza Wars&quot; as it became called by the local media was a skirmish betrween the pizzeria&#39;s in downtown Dayton OH. </p>
<p>It started as a battle of wits, or more to the point - witty advertising. First one pizzeria published an ad with a pun poking fun at a competitor, which prompted a swift response in equal measure. Soon all the pizzeria&#39;s were in on it, with the ads becoming something of a local attraction. Patrons loved the back and forth and looked forward to seeing who would out do the other next week when the Sunday newspaper showed up.</p>
<p>That was until &quot;The Pizza Baron&quot; showed up. A self styled pirate, The Baron started undercutting their compeitors and takign away customers. Eventually the friendly competition became anything but.</p>
<p>The Baron soon bought out most of the other pizerias in Dayton, except for Saul&#39;s. Saul fought against the growing pressure for as long as he could.</p>
<p>Saul decides, after being visited one too many times by the Baron&#39;s pirated clothed thugs, to use his ancient family recipie for dough to make a pizza like none others. He had meant to eat it himself and battle the Baron once and for all, but through happenstance and comedic errors, Tyler ate the first slice instead, bonding the magicks to him and him alone until he &#39;left the mortal coil&#39;.</p>
<p>A five year long War ensues, with the size altering Tyler fighting one pirate themed plot after another as The Baron fought for the heart and minds of the people of Dayton OH. Countless time Tyler succeded until that fateful day... </p>
<p>Saul ended up taking a deal, signing on to be the Baron&#39;s shill and give away the secrets of his magical dough. At least thats how Tyler sees it. True or not, there was a big show made that Saul was the new head chat of &quot;The Pizza Baron&quot; and that was that.</p>
